This Project was made for a Coding Challenge given by a company as a entry test.
This Project is my response to the challenge. It consists of all the features and even a little more like some methods to get some more informations.

## The Challenge: 
The city of Vence is in need of assistance in implementing a new parking garage and has requested your help for this purpose.
The garage is intended to support different types of vehicles:
- Cars
- Motorcycles
  
Each vehicle has a unique ID (the license plate) and can only exist once, whether inside or outside of the parking garage.
The planned parking garage is expected to support multiple levels, however, due to structural considerations, the city of Vence is not yet certain about the maximum height the parking garage can be built. As a result, the application should be flexible in being able to adjust the number of levels.
Similarly, the application should be flexible and configurable for the number of parking spaces per level, as the property for constructing the parking garage has not yet been determined.
Your task is to develop a simulation program for the parking garage. Vehicles should be able to enter and exit the garage. The application should assign a free space to incoming vehicles or reject them if no free parking spaces are available.
The manager of the parking garage should be able to inquire about the position of a specific vehicle within the system. The response should include both the level and the assigned parking space. Additionally, it should be possible to query the number of remaining free parking spaces.
